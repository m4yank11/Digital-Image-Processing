# Digital-Image-Processing
# Image Processing Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic image processing techniques using OpenCV. 
The first script focuses on histogram equalization to improve image contrast, and the second script shows how to adjust the brightness of an image by brightening or darkening it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for displaying images)
